excerpt: 'This study has provided the first catalog of genetic factors affecting molecular phenotypes that describe the pig blood metabolome, with links to important metabolic pathways, opening novel avenues to merge genetics and nutrition in this livestock species. The obtained results are relevant for basic and applied biology and to evaluate the pig as a biomedical model. Genetically influenced metabolites can be further exploited in nutrigenetic approaches in pigs. The described molecular phenotypes can be useful to dissect complex traits and design novel feeding, breeding and selection programs in pigs.'

Metabolomics opens novel avenues to study the basic biological mechanisms underlying complex traits, starting from characterization of metabolites. Metabolites and their levels in a biofluid represent simple molecular phenotypes (metabotypes) that are direct products of enzyme activities and relate to all metabolic pathways, including catabolism and anabolism of nutrients. In this study, we demonstrated the utility of merging metabolomics and genomics in pigs to uncover a large list of genetic factors that influence mammalian metabolism.
