excerpt: "Pigs can be infected or co-infected with numerous pathogenic andnon-pathogenic viruses, making it challenging to interpret clinical symptoms. Diagnosticassays should provide unbiased results to help identify the infecting viruses. In thisstudy, we tested a new and potentially unbiased method to identify viral sequences inporcine blood. The approach involves whole-genome sequencing of all extracted DNAfrom blood, isolating short DNA sequences not part of the pig genome (unmapped reads)and identifying viral sequences within this fraction. This method was used to investigatea suspected outbreak of Post-weaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome on a pig farm.By utilising advanced DNA sequencing technology and bioinformatic analysis of DNAsequencing data, we identified sequences from 12 different viruses within the sequencingdata of nine diseased pigs from the farm. The results suggest a heterogeneous profile amongthe analysed pigs, potentially indicating potential secondary infections or co-infections.Considering the results of this pilot application, mining unmapped reads from whole-genome sequencing data can provide useful information to better understand complexviral disease states, which can help improve veterinary surveillance."

This pilot application demonstrated that a whole-genome sequencing approach can complement other routine diagnostic assays in veterinary virology.
