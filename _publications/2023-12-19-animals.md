excerpt: 'In this study, we explored the main alleles present in the ABO blood group gene (A and O) in different pig breeds and other Suinae species, and other variants besides these two major forms to investigate the evolution of ABO and its possible association with several production and blood-related traits.'

In this study, we explored the main alleles present in the ABO blood group gene (A and O) in different pig breeds and other Suinae species, and other variants besides these two major forms to investigate the evolution of ABO and its possible association with several production and blood-related traits.
