excerpt: 'High-throughput untargeted metabolomics was applied to study the pig metabolome.
    Two heavy pig breeds were compared with ad-hoc developed bioinformatic pipelines.
    Several metabolites were differentially abundant between breeds.
    The results confirm the influence of the specific genetic background on the metabolism.
    The obtained information may serve for practical applications in pig breeding and husbandry.'

This study aimed to compare the metabolomic profiles of two Italian heavy pig breeds (Italian Duroc and Italian Large White) used in crossbreeding programmes. The differences observed may shed light on the complementarities needed to turn on the heterotic effect in the resulting crossbred pigs. The developed metabolomic data analysis approaches provided comprehensive overviews of the metabolome features of the two breeds that aligned with some of their known characteristics. This suggests that overall metabolomic profiles could serve as important descriptors of breed−specific molecular traits.
