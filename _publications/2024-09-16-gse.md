excerpt: 'This study provided a first comprehensive analysis of NUMT present in the Sus scrofa genome, comparing them to NUMT found in other species within the order Cetartiodactyla. The NUMT-based evolutionary window that we reconstructed from NUMT integration ages could be useful to better understand the micro-evolutionary events that shaped the modern pig genome and enriched the genetic diversity of this species.'

This study provided a first comprehensive analysis of NUMT present in the Sus scrofa genome, comparing them to NUMT found in other species within the order Cetartiodactyla. The NUMT-based evolutionary window that we reconstructed from NUMT integration ages could be useful to better understand the micro-evolutionary events that shaped the modern pig genome and enriched the genetic diversity of this species.
