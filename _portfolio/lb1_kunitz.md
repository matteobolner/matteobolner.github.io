**Motivation:** The in-silico discrimination of the presence of kunitz-type domains in a protein sequence is  
of critical importance for the research and development of pharmaceutical drugs; the aim of this project  
is the functional annotation of non-reviewed Uniprot sequences through a hidden Markov model built on  
the structural alignment of known kunitz-type domains.  
**Results:** A hidden markov model able to discriminate between kunitz and non-kunitz domains was  
succesfully produced and optimized.
