I am a PhD student at the University of Bologna, working on applied genomics for sustainable animal production systems.  
I have a Bachelor's degree in **Biological Sciences** (2015-2018) and a Master's in **Bioinformatics** (2018-2021), both obtained at the University of Bologna.  
In the time between graduating and starting my PhD, I spent six months at the SuperComputing Applications and Innovation department (SCAI) of CINECA for a post-graduation internship, working on software containerization for HPC systems.  
I am extremely passionate about all things biology and computers; in my free time, I try to work on developing software for bioinformatics.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
