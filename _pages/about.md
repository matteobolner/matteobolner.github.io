My name is Matteo Bolner and I am a PhD student at the University of Bologna, where I am working on applied genomics and metabolomics for sustainable animal production systems.  
  
I have a Bachelor's degree in **Biological Sciences** (2015-2018) and a Master's in **Bioinformatics** (2018-2021), both obtained at the University of Bologna.  
Between graduating and starting my PhD, I spent six months at the SuperComputing Applications and Innovation department (SCAI) of CINECA for a post-graduation internship, working on software containerization for HPC systems.  
During my PhD, I spent three months at the animal breeding department of the INIA-CSIC institute in Madrid, where I worked on RNA-seq and metabolomics analyses for nutrigenomics.  
  
I am extremely passionate about all things biology and computers; in my free time, I try to work on developing software for bioinformatics, cooking and woodworking.
