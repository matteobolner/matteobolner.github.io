2021-09-24	Application of Next Generation Semiconductor-Based Sequencing for the Identification of Apis mellifera Complementary Sex Determiner (csd) Alleles from Honey DNA	insects	The applied methodology provided a new strategy to disclose the genetic diversity at the csd gene at the population-wide level and identify most, if not all, csd alleles present in the colonies in a single analysis.

2022-03-01	Mining livestock genome datasets for an unconventional characterization of animal DNA viromes	Genomics	In this study, we mined unmapped reads in WGS data for the identification of virus sequences in several livestock species	Bovo, S., Schiavo, G., Bolner, M., Ballan, M., & Fontanesi, L.

2023-12-19	Investigation of ABO Gene Variants across More Than 60 Pig Breeds and Populations and Other Suidae Species Using Whole-Genome Sequencing Datasets	animals	In this study, we explored the main alleles present in the ABO blood group gene (A and O) in different pig breeds and other Suinae species, and other variants besides these two major forms to investigate the evolution of ABO and its possible association with several production and blood-related traits.

2024-09-16	A comprehensive atlas of nuclear sequences of mitochondrial origin (NUMT) inserted into the pig genome	Genetics Selection Evolution	This study provided a first comprehensive analysis of NUMT present in the Sus scrofa genome, comparing them to NUMT found in other species within the order Cetartiodactyla. The NUMT-based evolutionary window that we reconstructed from NUMT integration ages could be useful to better understand the micro-evolutionary events that shaped the modern pig genome and enriched the genetic diversity of this species.
