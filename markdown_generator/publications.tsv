2021-09-24	Application of Next Generation Semiconductor-Based Sequencing for the Identification of Apis mellifera Complementary Sex Determiner (csd) Alleles from Honey DNA	insects	The applied methodology provided a new strategy to disclose the genetic diversity at the csd gene at the population-wide level and identify most, if not all, csd alleles present in the colonies in a single analysis.

2023-12-19	Investigation of ABO Gene Variants across More Than 60 Pig Breeds and Populations and Other Suidae Species Using Whole-Genome Sequencing Datasets	animals	In this study, we explored the main alleles present in the ABO blood group gene (A and O) in different pig breeds and other Suinae species, and other variants besides these two major forms to investigate the evolution of ABO and its possible association with several production and blood-related traits.
